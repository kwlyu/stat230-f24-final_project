## Data Wrangling

```

## EDA

```{r}

## Logistic Regression

```{r}

                     data = happiness_recode, family = binomial)

summary(happiness_glm)
vif(happiness_glm)
```

```{r}
empirical_plot_fn <- function(quant_var, cat_var, scale = "lin") {
  # Convert strings to symbols
  quant_group <- rlang::sym(quant_var)
  cat_group <- rlang::sym(cat_var)
  
  happiness_ag <- happiness_recode %>% 
    mutate(quant_grouped = 
             ntile(!!quant_group, n = 10) # Group the quantitative variable into 10 groups
    ) %>% 
    group_by(quant_grouped, !!cat_group) %>%
    summarize(
      quant_gp_median = median(!!quant_group), # Calculate median within each group
      p = sum(happy == 1) / n(), # Proportion happy
      log_odds = log(p / (1 - p)), # Avoid log issues
      .groups = "drop" # Avoid warning about grouping
    )
  
  # Add a column for x_var based on the scale
  happiness_ag <- happiness_ag %>%
    mutate(x_var = if (scale == "log") log(quant_gp_median) else quant_gp_median)
  
  # Set the x-axis label
  x_lab <- str_c(if (scale == "log") "Log Median of " else "Median of ", quant_var)
  
  # Plot using precomputed x_var
  ggplot(happiness_ag,

    geom_point() +
    labs(x = x_lab, y = "Empirical Log Odds")
}


# Iterate over all different combinations
